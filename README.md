# machine-learning-challenge

Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I will create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Necessary Libraries
* sklearn
* joblib
* pandas
* tensorflow

## Model Results
* KNN (Train/Test): 0.848/0.830
